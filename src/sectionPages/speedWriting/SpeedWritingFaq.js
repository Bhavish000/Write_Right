                                    Yes, the legibility and speed can go hand in hand. The concept of our speed handwriting program is to ensure good quality handwriting along with speed. Our techniques are scientifically proven to deliver 100% results.

                                    On average the speed can be leveraged by 50%. The speed varies from person to person. Every individual can achieve a different level of increase in the writing speed. But after the training writing speed is certainly going to increase.

                                    The results are permanent as we teach the students based on scientifically proven techniques. The retention depends upon the capability of the students and their conscious efforts in implementing the advice into their writing.

                                    The technology used for increasing speed is based on 3 Mâ€™s: M= Myth, M= Motivation, M= Music. We break the myth that writing in speed distorts handwriting. Our trainers are experts in motivating the students to write fast. During the speed writing course, specially created music is played that helps to enhance the writing speed.

                                    Although there is no fixed standard, 25-30 words per minute are considered to be good writing speed. A writing speed that enables a student to meet the deadlines in his/her examination, without distorting the legibility, is good.
