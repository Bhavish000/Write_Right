                                <p class="text-justify text-white"> The complexities of the teaching methods brought us into the Education segment, and we decided to move ahead with our tagline, &apos;Education Simplified.&apos; We have been in the field for the last 26 years.</p>

                                <p class="text-justify text-white">We started by focusing on handwriting and the most common errors occurring while writing. Our research team identified fifty-six types of errors. We developed simple methods to identify these errors in handwriting and subsequently developed methods to repair them. We teamed with educationists across the country and made available these handwriting solutions for school students and anyone looking to improve their handwriting or add speed to it.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify text-white">Over the years, we went Global by joining hands with the educationists of different countries. We are the world&apos;s largest chain of Handwriting institutes.</p>
                                <p class="text-justify text-white">With the change in the learning process owing to the development in technology, we developed Online Handwriting Classes. With this, we are globally available to any interested student with just a single click.</p>
